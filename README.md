PoC for cve-2021-4034

Based on the PoC by https://haxx.in: https://haxx.in/files/blasty-vs-pkexec.c. Probably he's https://github.com/blasty?! I don't know.

With a little help from https://github.com/daimoniac


# How to use?
## Compile cve-2021-4034.c
```
gcc -Wall cve-2021-4034.c -o cve-2021-4034-exploit
```

## Execute ansible playbook
**Change variable `hosts` in `asses_CVE-2021-4034.yml` to your usecase!**
```
ansible-playbook -i </path/to/inventory.yml> </path/to/playbooks/>asses_CVE-2021-4034.yml
```

The playbook copies the exploit to the host, executes it and evaluates `whoami` on multiple occasions and checks for "root" as return value of the exploit.

On hosts where the task `Check result of privilege escalation` fails a privilge escalation was successful. 
In the play recap hosts which don't have `failed=0` are vulnerable.

# What does it do?

Deep down? I have no idea. Weired memory mashups probably. 

What's essential for the operability of this anbible playbook is https://github.com/mike-artemis/cve-2021-4034/blob/main/cve-2021-4034.c#L50. The plain exploit by https://haxx.in/files/blasty-vs-pkexec.c only opens a root-shell and the ansible playbook is stuck in it. 
Changing the payload of the exploit to 
```
"  static char *a_argv[] = { \"bash\",  \"-c\",  \"whoami\", NULL };\n"
```
return the current user. The playbook checks the user for privilege escapation and fails the playbook if it happened.
